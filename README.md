# Attendance-marking-robot-using-facial-recognition-
We developed this project for J-component purposes for subject ECE3501 - IoT Fundamentals
We developed a wheeled robot which can move around the classroom and take attendance of students using Facial recognition and lists the names of all students present in a text fail and mails it to the faculty.
This project mainly contains two parts:
1. Obstacle avoidance
2. Facial recognition

Components used: Arduino, Motor drive, Ultrasonic sensors, Raspberry Pi, Batteries, USB Camera, Powerbank.

The code for facial recognition part is provided in face_regmail.py file

The code for the obstacle avoidance part is provided in obstacleavoidance.ino

We have attached our project report for more detailed explanation of our project in file report_merged.pdf
